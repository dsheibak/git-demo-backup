We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom
All we got was blues

But through all the sorrow
We've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go

And after all the sorrow
We'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I'll never let you go, let you go
