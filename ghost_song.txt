We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom
All we got was blues

But through all the sorrow
We've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Your beauty never, ever scared me
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

We were searching for reasons
To play by the rules
But we quickly found
It was just for fools

And after all the sorrow
We'll be riding high
